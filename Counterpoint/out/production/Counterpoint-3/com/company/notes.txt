Changes to hasOneApex or changes to illegal leap (to include tritone and leaps of 7ths) caused melodies that start on 12 to repeat 11 and 12 a LOT
idea... create a constructor that allows you to set the first and last notes
debug it
watch what happens to see why you get stuck at 11 and 12
Replace illegal apex is causing an index-1 out of bounds exception.



Removed "illegal apex" mode (commented out)
restored hasOneApex to previous version
hasOneApex isn't working for when -5 is the lowest note and 0 is the starting note. some simple condition like, -5 can never repeat. And another one like, 12 can only happen once in the middle.
Still need to find a way to make sure that 2 is never the lowest note.
